# The_Sparks_Foundation_Tasks
Task 1 is about prediction of percentage was made based on number of hours of studies for a student using python.
Prediction model is using supervised ML.
Firstly libraries are imported, then data is imported.Data is explored further.
It is then visualised using matplotlib.
Then data is prepared as test & training data, as model is made from training data & it is then tested from test data, using linera regression.
Then finally model is evaluated. 
Task 2 is about prediction using Unsupervised ML for Iris Dataset, to predict cluster using python.
Firstly importing libraries like Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn & seaborn.
Then importing data, then exploring it, cleansing data. Data visualization using seaborn.
Preparing data then using k-means cluster to find the most frequent occurrence of the type of iris flower.
